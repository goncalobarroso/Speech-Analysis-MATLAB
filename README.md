## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal is to develop a robust model for identifying spoken digits from audio signals. The **AudioMNIST** dataset was used, consisting of 60 participants, each pronouncing digits from 0 to 9 fifty times.

## üìã Description

### Features:
- **Temporal Analysis**: Extracting features like energy, amplitude, and signal duration to distinguish digits.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Using **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to analyze the frequency domain and extract the median amplitude spectrum.
- **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**: Time-varying frequency analysis for capturing complex audio characteristics.

### Dataset:
- **60 participants**, each saying digits **0-9**.
- **48 KHz** sampling rate.
- Each digit is spoken **50 times**, leading to a rich variety of audio data for analysis.
